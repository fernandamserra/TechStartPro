# Tech Interview @ __Oilist__

For the backend, it was used JavaScript with Node.js to develop a RESTFul API . The front end was made with React.js. The goal was to develop a plataform able to execute the CRUD described in [here](https://github.com/olist/TechStartPro) .

-----

## Machine specs:

- INTEL i5 - 6200U
- 8GB RAM
- Linux Mint 19.1 Xfce
- Developed using Visual Studio Code 

------------------

## Running the Application

Before running the application you need to go to the backend directory and install all the dependencies with:
> npm install

After this, you need to run the rebuild.bash 
> build

Still in the backend directory run the server with:
> npm start

To run the web app, run the same command in the folder 'frontend'.

Thank you for the opportunity!
